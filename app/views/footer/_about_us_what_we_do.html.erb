            <p>2011 is the year which saw the meteoric rise of ecommerce in India. 2012 will be an year of expansion and consolidation. In coming years too, this rise will continue and revolutionising forever the way India shops.
	This ecommerce trend has created few problems as well.
	<ul>
    <li>As there are so many online shopping portals, it is difficult for a shopper to visit all such portals and find the best deal.</li>
    <br/>
	<li>Only few shopping portals become popular, whereas, there is a long tail of 'not so popular' shopping portals selling products at a cheaper price than popular shopping portals.</li>
    <br/>
	<li>There is a big market of local retailers which plays a second fiddle to market of online shopping portals. There is no level playing field for local retailers to compete with online shopping portals. </li>
    </ul>
